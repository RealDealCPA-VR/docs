## General Real Estate Terms

### What is Appreciation?

**Appreciation** refers to the increase in a property's value over time. This can occur due to market conditions, improvements to the property, or changes in the surrounding area. There are two types:

- **Natural Appreciation**: Market-driven increases in property value
- **Forced Appreciation**: Value increases due to property improvements or renovations

Appreciation is a key component of real estate investment returns alongside cash flow.

### What is Cash Flow?

**Cash Flow** is the net income generated by a rental property after all expenses are paid. It's calculated as:

- **Positive Cash Flow**: Property generates more income than expenses
- **Negative Cash Flow**: Property expenses exceed rental income (like the -\$282 monthly shown in your analysis)
- **Cash-on-Cash Return**: Annual cash flow divided by initial cash investment

### What is Cap Rate (Capitalization Rate)?

**Cap Rate** is a metric used to evaluate the profitability of a real estate investment. It represents the rate of return on a property based on the income it generates.

- Higher cap rates generally indicate higher returns but potentially higher risk
- Used to compare similar properties in the same market
- Typical ranges: 4-10% depending on property type and location

### What is Net Operating Income (NOI)?

**Net Operating Income (NOI)** is the total income generated by a property minus operating expenses, but before mortgage payments and taxes.

Operating expenses include:

- Property management fees
- Maintenance and repairs
- Insurance
- Property taxes
- Utilities (if paid by owner)
- Vacancy allowance

### What is Operating Margin?

**Operating Margin** shows how efficiently a property generates income before debt service. It's calculated as:

A 59.7% operating margin (as shown in your analysis) means the property retains about 60 cents of every rental dollar after operating expenses.

### What is Net Profit Margin?

**Net Profit Margin** includes all expenses including mortgage payments:

A negative net profit margin (like -33.6% in your analysis) indicates the property loses money after all expenses.

## Financing Terms

### What is Loan-to-Value Ratio (LTV)?

**Loan-to-Value Ratio (LTV)** is the percentage of a property's value that is financed through a mortgage.

- **80% LTV**: $200,000 loan on $250,000 property
- Lower LTV ratios typically result in better loan terms
- Investment properties often require 20-25% down payment (75-80% LTV)

### What is Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR)?

**Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR)** measures a property's ability to pay its debt obligations.

- **DSCR \> 1.0**: Property generates enough income to cover debt payments
- **DSCR \< 1.0**: Property doesn't generate enough income to cover debt (like the 0.90x in your analysis)
- Lenders typically require DSCR of 1.2 or higher for investment properties

### What is a Hard Money Loan?

**Hard Money Loans** are short-term, asset-based loans typically used for real estate investments.

**Characteristics:**

- Short terms (6 months to 3 years)
- Higher interest rates (8-15%)
- Based on property value, not borrower creditworthiness
- Quick closing (1-2 weeks)

**Common Uses:**

- Fix and flip projects
- Bridge financing
- Properties that don't qualify for traditional financing

### What is Owner Financing?

**Owner Financing** (also called seller financing) occurs when the property seller acts as the lender.

**How it works:**

- Buyer makes payments directly to seller
- Seller retains legal title until paid in full
- Terms negotiated between buyer and seller

**Benefits:**

- Faster closing process
- Flexible terms
- May help buyers who don't qualify for traditional loans

## Investment Strategies

- Benefit from long-term appreciation
- Build equity through mortgage paydown
- Tax advantages through depreciation

**Ideal for:**

- Investors seeking passive income
- Long-term wealth building
- Tax benefits

### What is Fix and Flip?

**Fix and Flip** involves purchasing distressed properties, renovating them, and selling them quickly for profit.

**Process:**

1. Find undervalued property
2. Purchase at below-market price
3. Renovate to increase value
4. Sell for profit

**Key Considerations:**

- Requires construction/renovation knowledge
- Higher risk but potentially higher returns
- Short-term capital gains tax implications

**Wholesaling** involves finding distressed properties under contract and assigning the contract to another investor for a fee.

**Process:**

1. Find motivated seller
2. Get property under contract at below-market price

- Quick transactions
- No property ownership

**Requirements:**

- Live in one unit of a small apartment building

**Benefits:**

- Reduced living expenses
- Learn landlording while living on-site

### What is the BRRRR Strategy?

**BRRRR** stands for Buy, Rehab, Rent, Refinance, Repeat - a strategy for building a rental portfolio with limited capital.

**Process:**

1. **Buy**: Purchase distressed property below market value
2. **Rehab**: Renovate to increase value and rental potential
3. **Rent**: Place tenants and establish cash flow
4. **Refinance**: Get new loan based on improved value
5. **Repeat**: Use pulled-out equity for next investment

**Benefits:**

- Recycle initial capital
- Build portfolio faster
- Force appreciation through improvements

## Property Analysis Metrics

### What is the 1% Rule?

**The 1% Rule** is a quick screening tool that suggests monthly rent should equal at least 1% of the purchase price.

**Example:**

- $200,000 property should rent for at least $2,000/month

**Note:** This is a screening tool, not a guarantee of profitability. Always perform detailed analysis.

### What is the 2% Rule?

**The 2% Rule** is a more aggressive version of the 1% rule, suggesting monthly rent should equal 2% of purchase price.

**Reality:**

- Very difficult to achieve in most markets
- More common in lower-cost areas
- Often indicates higher-risk investments

**Use:** As an aspirational goal rather than a strict requirement.

### What is Gross Rent Multiplier (GRM)?

**Gross Rent Multiplier (GRM)** is used to quickly compare investment properties.

**Interpretation:**

- Lower GRM = potentially better deal
- Compare similar properties in same area
- Typical range: 4-12 depending on market

**Limitation:** Doesn't account for expenses or vacancy rates.

### What is Price-to-Rent Ratio?

**Price-to-Rent Ratio** compares the purchase price to annual rental income.

A 15.0:1 ratio (as shown in your analysis) means it would take 15 years of rent to equal the purchase price, which is relatively high and suggests the property may be overpriced for rental income.

### What is Internal Rate of Return (IRR)?

**Internal Rate of Return (IRR)** is the discount rate that makes the net present value of all cash flows equal to zero.

**What it measures:**

- Time value of money
- Overall return considering timing of cash flows
- Accounts for initial investment, annual cash flows, and sale proceeds

**Use:** Compare investments with different holding periods and cash flow patterns.

### What is Cash-on-Cash Return?

**Cash-on-Cash Return** measures the annual return on the actual cash invested.

A negative cash-on-cash return (like -6% in your analysis) means you're losing money on your initial investment annually.

## Tax-Related Terms

### What is Depreciation in Real Estate?

**Depreciation** is a tax deduction that allows you to recover the cost of income-producing property over time.

**Key Points:**

- Residential rental property: 27.5-year depreciation schedule
- Commercial property: 39-year depreciation schedule
- Only the building depreciates, not the land
- Reduces taxable income annually

**Calculation:**

- Front-loads depreciation deductions

**Benefits:**

- Increased cash flow through tax savings
- Particularly beneficial for high-income investors
- Can be applied to both new purchases and existing properties

### What is Passive Activity Loss?

**Passive Activity Loss** rules limit the ability to deduct rental property losses against other income.

**Key Rules:**

- **High DOM**: Buyer's market, more inventory available
- **Average DOM**: Balanced market conditions

**Investment Implications:**

- High DOM properties may have motivated sellers
- Market timing considerations for selling
- Indicator of local market conditions

### What is Absorption Rate?

**Absorption Rate** measures how quickly available properties are sold in a specific market during a given time period.

**Interpretation:**

- **High Rate**: Strong demand, seller's market
- **Low Rate**: Weak demand, buyer's market
- Typically measured monthly

**Use:** Helps determine market timing and pricing strategies.

## Property Management Terms

### What is Vacancy Rate?

**Vacancy Rate** is the percentage of time a rental property remains unoccupied.

**Planning:**

- Budget for 5-10% vacancy rate in most markets
- Higher vacancy rates in transitional neighborhoods
- Factor into cash flow calculations (like the \$88.61/month vacancy allowance in your analysis)

**Factors Affecting Vacancy:**

- Property condition and amenities
- Rental price competitiveness
- Local market conditions
- Property management quality

### What is Gross Rental Yield?

**Gross Rental Yield** is the annual rental income as a percentage of the property's value.

**Example:**

## Understanding Your Analysis Results

### Interpreting Negative Cash Flow

When your analysis shows negative cash flow (like the -\$282 monthly in your example), it means:

- **Monthly Shortfall**: You'll need to contribute money each month to cover the difference
- **Higher Risk**: If rental income decreases or expenses increase, losses compound
- **Appreciation Dependence**: Returns rely heavily on property value increases
- **Tax Benefits**: Losses may provide tax deductions (consult with CPA)

### What Your Metrics Mean

Based on your analysis showing:

- **Cap Rate: 2%** - Very low, indicating poor income relative to property value
- **Cash-on-Cash: -6%** - Negative return on your cash investment
- **DSCR: 0.90x** - Property doesn't generate enough income to cover debt service
- **Operating Margin: 59.7%** - Good expense control before mortgage payments
- **Net Profit Margin: -33.6%** - Significant losses after all expenses

### Risk Assessment Factors

Your analysis shows "High Risk" (35%) due to:

- **Negative cash flow** requiring monthly contributions
- **Low cap rate** compared to market standards
- **Poor debt coverage** with DSCR below 1.0
- **High price-to-rent ratio** at 15.0:1

### Optimal Price Points

Your analysis suggests better cap rates at lower purchase prices:

- **5% Cap Rate**: \$356,563 (current analysis shows 2%)
- **10% Cap Rate**: \$178,282
- **15% Cap Rate**: \$118,854

This indicates the property may be overpriced for its income potential.
