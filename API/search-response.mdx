## What is the Search Response?

The search response is returned by the API when a user performs a property search. It provides a list of real estate listings that match the search criteria, including key details about each property such as title, description, price, and more.

## Usefulness

This response is useful for displaying search results to users in real estate applications, enabling them to browse, compare, and select properties of interest. It provides structured data that can be used for further analysis, filtering, or integration into investment tools.

This document describes the structure and meaning of the search response returned by the API.
