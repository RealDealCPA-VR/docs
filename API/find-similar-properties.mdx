# Find Similar Properties Documentation

## What is the Find Similar Properties Response?

The find similar properties response is returned by the API when a user requests comparable properties for a given address. It provides a list of properties that are similar in location, size, and features to the target property, along with relevant details for each comparable.

## Usefulness

The find similar properties response is valuable for:
- Real estate professionals and investors who need to analyze comparable properties for pricing, valuation, or investment decisions.
- Application users who want to benchmark a property against others in the area.

By surfacing similar properties, this response enables more accurate market analysis, supports negotiation, and helps users make informed decisions.
