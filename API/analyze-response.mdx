## What is the Analyze Response?

The analyze response is returned by the API when a user requests a detailed investment analysis for a specific property. It aggregates property details, financial projections, comparable rentals, and investment metrics into a single, comprehensive report.

## Usefulness

This response is valuable for real estate investors, analysts, and application users who need to evaluate the financial viability of a property. It enables users to assess cash flow, expenses, returns, and compare similar rentals, supporting informed investment decisions and risk assessment.

This document describes the structure and meaning of the response returned by the `/analyze` API endpoint.
